# Sketches

This repo contains python code (and supporting SVGs) to generate vector drawings for output to a plotter.

It relies on the [Axi driver by fogleman](https://github.com/fogleman/axi).

The Axi driver works with many [AxiDraw](https://axidraw.com/) compatible plotters, basically anything that uses the [EBB](http://www.schmalzhaus.com/EBB/) board/firmware. A much cheaper alternative to the AxiDraw is the [iDraw](https://uunatek.com/product/idraw/), which I use.
